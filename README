This is the code for the Twilio Snake game I built as part of my 'Fun and Games with Twilio' presentation at the 2011 Twilio Conference. It's pretty rough and was put together in just a couple hours, so don't hate. If people report bugs, I'll try and fix but this is mostly out there as a learning tool. Have fun!
